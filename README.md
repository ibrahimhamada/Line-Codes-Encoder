# Line-Codes-Encoder

My Project of the Communications Theory and Systems Course Offered in Spring 2021 @ Zewail City.

In this project, I implemented a GUI to help users encode a quantized discrete signal.


Encoder function and GUI should have the option that the user chooses between:
1) Unipolar NRZ signaling
2) Polar RZ signaling
3) Alternate mark inversion (AMI) signaling
4) Manchester signaling

The GUI allows the user to input a stream of bits to be encoded. The GUI also gives the user the option to generate N random bits, where N is determined by the user.
